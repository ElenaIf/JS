    <h1>Practice exercise</h1>
    <h2>The task is:</h2>
    <p> Create a software that generate 5 random numbers of either 0 or 1</p>
    <p> Let the user knows which are the 5 random numbers that they have gotten with console.log or alert</p>
    <p>  If the user get all five 1s, congrat the user because he/she has won a jackpot prize. </p>
    <p> Also show them what has been the chance of winning the jackpot by performing a calculation of the winning probability (basically 1/2^5)</p>
    <p> If the user get all five 0s, congrat them anyway because it is as hard as winning the jackpot except he/she didnâ€™t win anything </p>

    <h2>To see how the solution works, open the console.</h2>
