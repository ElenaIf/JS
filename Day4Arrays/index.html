      <h1>Task 1</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create an **array of 5 elements**, each element is a random number of
          either 1 or 0
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a while loop, that goes through each element in the array,
          check if they are 1 or 0
        </li>
        <li>
          Also create a counter variable to keep track of the number of 1 and 0
          values in the array
        </li>
        <li>If the number of 1s is 5, announce the jackpot prize</li>
        <li>If the number of 0s is 5, announce the congrat message</li>
        <li>If the number of 1s is 3 < x < 5, announce smaller prize</li>
        <li>
          Create a while loop that will run the above application for an
          undefinite number of time, and only break out of the loop if the
          jackpot prize is won.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a variable to keep track of many rounds have been played in
          order to win the jackpot
        </li>
        <li>
          If each round costs 50 cents, run the above program 5 times, either
          manually or use a while loop to help you, in order to learn the
          average amount of money you have to spend on winning a jackpot ðŸ˜„
        </li>
        <li>
          Increase the random number range to be any number between 0 - 5, run
          the program on number 9 again to see how much money you would actually
          have to spend to win a jackpot
        </li>
        <li>
          If the jackpot prize was 30000 EUR, how much profit/loss do you make?
        </li>
      </ol>
